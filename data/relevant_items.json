    "abstract": "HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma has a distinct biology and responds favourably to primary radiation (and surgery)-based treatments. The long-term survival benefit is, however, offset by chronic detrimental impact on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors due to treatment-related toxic effects such as dysphagia and xerostomia. Consequently, many toxicity-mitigating de-escalation methods are being explored for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.1 Minimally invasive primary transoral surgery followed by de-intensification of post-operative (chemo) radiation depending on pathological risk assessment is one such investigational approach.",

There is considerable variation in the prevalence of histopathologically detected extranodal extension in comparable studies. The Head and Neck Cancer International Group, which includes 23 organisations managing patients with head and neck cancer, identified several challenges in evaluating histopathologically detected extranodal extension. Thus, the Head and Neck Consensus Language for Ease and Reproducibility (HN-CLEAR) and its global stakeholders prioritised developing diagnostic criteria and uniform terminology for histopathologically detected extranodal extension.",

For IC, the investigators used the triplet combination of paclitaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil (TPF), whereas doublet cisplatin-fluorouracil (PF) was used for AC. The trial was powered to detect a 12% difference in progression-free survival (PFS) in favor of IC, and enrolled 324 patients, with 162 patients in each group. However, this was a negative trial with comparable 3-year PFS between IC plus CCRT and CCRT plus AC, contrasting the results of the NPC-0501 trial by the Hong Kong NPC study group, which showed an improvement for PFS in favor of IC, albeit subtle differences exist between both trials. Intriguingly, in the present study, IC was associated with poorer local control compared with AC.",

    "title": "Improving Palliative Care for Patients With Head and Neck Cancer",
    "abstract": "In this issue of JAMA Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Fu et al used data from the Ontario Cancer Registry to evaluate palliative care (PC) use in 11 135 patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) during their last year of life. They found that PC was utilized in 90% of patients and was associated with increased monthly costs at the end of life, a greater number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions, and a lower likelihood of dying at home compared to non-PC recipients. The majority of PC was received in the inpatient setting and was initiated in the last 6 months of life. Gastrostomy and/or tracheostomy tube placement occurred in 11% of patients in the last year of life and was associated with increased costs that were partially mitigated by early (&gt;6 months before death) PC involvement. The authors conclude that early PC involvement may attenuate the costs associated with tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube use in the last year of life but that it does not reduce the use of aggressive hospital-based care or facilitate home deaths. These findings highlight the high symptom burden associated with HNC end-of-life care and demonstrate gaps in the current delivery of PC to this population.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but combination studies in the definitive disease setting with concurrent chemoradiation have been disappointing. New results from the KEYNOTE-689 phase 3 trial suggest the addition of neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab in the perioperative setting may represent a new standard of care for resectable locally advanced HNSCC. Pembrolizumab improved event-free survival (EFS) by a median of 21.4 months compared to standard therapy. This trial also established safety in the surgical setting; similar proportions of patients in both the treatment and control arms successfully completed surgery. These findings may transform the treatment landscape of resectable locally advanced HNSCC, where current 3-year progression-free survival remains between 49% and 64%. While the contribution of components, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant, in KEYNOTE-689 remains undefined, identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from ICI therapy in the definitive setting is an important goal.",

    "title": "Considerations and Cautions in Postoperative Circulating Tumor HPV DNA Kinetics",
    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)–associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a rapidly evolving field in which HPV circulating tumor  DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for cancer response and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. In a study published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery, Yin et al investigate the kinetics of postoperative HPV ctDNA in a cohort of patients undergoing primary surgery for HPV-OPSCC. In this prospective study of 84 patients, 57 (82.6%) had detectable pretreatment samples. Of those, 35 patients had blood draws at both specified time points: postoperative day (POD) 1 to 2 and postoperative week (POW) 2. Similar to previous studies, these data support a correlation between preoperative HPV ctDNA levels and tumor stage, size of nodal disease, and presence of extranodal extension. The crux of this recent work, however, focuses on the positive and negative predictive values in addition to specific timing considerations of postoperative circulating tumor DNA detectability. Of 35 patients with complete blood draws, 16 (45.7%) remained detectable at POD 1 to 2; however of these, only 3 continued to be detectable at POW 2. These data yield a negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 74%-100%) and a positive predictive value of 19% (95% CI, 4%-46%), highlighting the superior reliability of the 2-week time point for MRD assessment. The authors propose an algorithm whereby patients with detectable samples on POD 1 to 2 undergo repeat testing at POW 2 if being used to guide adjuvant decisions. This 2-step approach balances timely risk stratification with avoidance of overtreatment, recognizing that adjuvant therapy planning requires a lead time of up to 6 weeks for multidisciplinary coordination. Of note, use of MRD for adjuvant decisions is currently restricted to clinical trials as this is not yet standard of care.",
