    "abstract": "HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma has a distinct biology and responds favourably to primary radiation (and surgery)-based treatments. The long-term survival benefit is, however, offset by chronic detrimental impact on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors due to treatment-related toxic effects such as dysphagia and xerostomia. Consequently, many toxicity-mitigating de-escalation methods are being explored for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.1 Minimally invasive primary transoral surgery followed by de-intensification of post-operative (chemo) radiation depending on pathological risk assessment is one such investigational approach.",

For IC, the investigators used the triplet combination of paclitaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil (TPF), whereas doublet cisplatin-fluorouracil (PF) was used for AC. The trial was powered to detect a 12% difference in progression-free survival (PFS) in favor of IC, and enrolled 324 patients, with 162 patients in each group. However, this was a negative trial with comparable 3-year PFS between IC plus CCRT and CCRT plus AC, contrasting the results of the NPC-0501 trial by the Hong Kong NPC study group, which showed an improvement for PFS in favor of IC, albeit subtle differences exist between both trials. Intriguingly, in the present study, IC was associated with poorer local control compared with AC.",

    "abstract": "To the Editor I read with great interest the recent study by Du et al, “Updated Thresholds of Basal Calcitonin Level and Extent of Lymph Node Metastasis in Initially Treated Medullary Thyroid Cancer,” and the accompanying Invited Commentary. However, the results reported in Table 2 appear internally inconsistent, possibly due to transposing of the sensitivity and specificity columns for American Thyroid Association (ATA) serum calcitonin thresholds of 20, 50, and 500 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 0.292); however, for 200 pg/mL, they seem correct. The ATA thresholds were originally chosen to minimize the false negative rate. In this context, the reported very low sensitivity for the 50 pg/mL cutoff—implying a very high false negative rate—is implausible, as is the correspondingly very high specificity; the same applies for the cutoff values of 50 and 500 pg/mL.",

    "abstract": "In Reply We thank Colli for his thoughtful comments on our study. We would like to provide a detailed clarification to address what we believe a misunderstanding regarding our updated thresholds. First, we fully agree that the ATA thresholds seek to minimize missed LNMs by adopting very low preoperative calcitonin cutoffs. However, this inevitably leads to an extremely high rate of overtreatment, resulting in unnecessary complications and surgical morbidity. For example, under the current cutoffs, patients newly diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer and with preoperative calcitonin greater than 20 pg/mL would be considered for lateral neck dissection. In our data, patients with calcitonin levels of 20 to 50 pg/mL had 5-year structural recurrence-free survival rates of 92.1% and 100% in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, with no recurrences observed in the validation cohort, comparable to 92.7% and 93.0% in the 241.9 to 693.9 pg/mL group. Thus, prophylactic neck dissection in patients with calcitonin levels of 20 to 50 pg/mL would likely lead to substantial overtreatment.",

We apologize that there has been an error in the text (for which a correction note has been published), which may have given the impression that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were known when transoral ultrasonography was performed. To clarify, the transoral ultrasonography was performed as an extension of the clinical examination during the patient’s first visit to the outpatient cancer clinic. MRI was performed afterwards; therefore, the transoral ultrasonography was blinded to the MRI and biopsy results. Our exclusion criteria also stated that any participants with available cross-sectional imaging at their first visit were not included.",

Although previous literature has endorsed routine removal of the contralateral palatine tonsil as standard of care to prevent the emergence of second primary tumors, valid counterpoints to this argument should be considered.",
